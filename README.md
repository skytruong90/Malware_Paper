# Title: Detecting Mobile Malware Associated with Global Pandemics

## Abstract
The existence of more than 6 billion smartphones worldwide can enable governments and public health organizations to develop mobile apps to prepare, track, and treat global pandemic diseases and their effects. However, rogue actors can take advantage of this opportunity during global health emergencies to target the public in farious ways (such as the use of various types of malware). We briefly review and analyze use cases of smartphone apps to enhance public response to pandemics and disease outbreaks. Next, we discuss how malicious actors could exploit worldwide pandemic emergencies to develop malware apps disguised as legitimate pandemic apps. Considering the worldwide COVID-19 Android malware, we propose the use of app permissions to develop Machine Learning (ML) models to enable the fast-detection of pandemic-related malware in smartphones. Our results show that pandemic-related malware mobile apps can be detected to a considerable extent using app permissions, thus helping the public to avoid pandemicsrelated smartphone malware in future pandemics and other worldwide health emergencies and outbreaks.
